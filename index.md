DAIREL is a Data Science research group that focuses on aspects of Data, Information and the interaction with it. DAIRELs research tries to bridge the gap between data-driven (e.g., application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Language Technologies in Big Data collections) and user-driven (e.g., by looking at how users interact with information) approaches. DAIREL follows a holistic view that combines a system-oriented with a user-oriented view. Following the thought experiment of Schr√∂dinger's Cat, the different n-grams of DAIREL can be interpreted differently

- DA stands for data, the buildoing block of our work;
- AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, including Deep Learning, Transformers and all the exciting tools that are available for us;
- I stands for Interaction, to investigate how users are using and interacting with data and information for their tasks;
- IRE stands for Information Retrieval, the task of finding relevant information to satisfy user's information needs;
- L stands for language, including language technologies and Large Language Models, essential tool to help analysing textual and multimodal data.
