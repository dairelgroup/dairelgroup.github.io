# About DAIREL

DAIREL is a Data Science research group at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK. The group focuses on all aspects of data, information and the interaction with it, with the aim to reduce Information Overload. DAIREL's research tries to bridge the gap between data-driven (e.g., application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Language Technologies in Big Data collections) and user-driven (e.g., by looking at how users interact with information) approaches. DAIREL follows a holistic view that combines a system-oriented with a user-oriented view. In the nature of the thought experiment of Schr√∂dinger's Cat, the different n-grams of DAIREL can be interpreted differently at the same time:

- **DA** stands for _Data_, the building block of our work and the fuel of our information society; data can be textual or multimedia as well as heterogeneous - turning data into information is part of our mission;
- **AI** stands for _Artificial Intelligence_, including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Transformers, Embeddings, Logics and other intelligent data processing and generative technologies we are applying in our work;
- **I** stands for _Interaction_, to investigate how users interacting with data and information for their tasks, and to provide solutions for fair and unbiased interaction;
- **IRE** stands for _Information Retrieval_, the task of satisfying user's information needs;
- **REL** stands for _Relevance_, a core concept in Information Retrieval; to tackle information overload, we need to separate relevant from irrelevant information;
- **L** stands for _Language_, including (generative) natural language technologies and Large Language Models, essential tools to help analyse textual and multimodal data, and driving conversational agents.

We think to develop effective and efficient applications and services, all these different parts that make DAIREL should not be seen in isolation, but need to be integrated.
