# About DAIREL

DAIREL is a Data Science research group at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK. The group focuses on all aspects of data, information and the interaction with it, with the aim to reduce information overload. Recent developments in language models, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction and information retrieval are continuing to transform our information society on several levels. To exploit the opportunities and address the challenges these developments bring with it, DAIREL's research tries to bridge the gap between data-driven and user-driven approaches. We look at how Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Search Engine and Language Technologies as well as Human-Computer Interaction can be used to support users' interaction with data and information in Big Data collections, in a fair and unbiased manner. DAIREL therefore follows a holistic view that integrates user as well as system aspects, which should not be seen in isolation. In the nature of the thought experiment of Schr√∂dinger's Cat, the different n-grams of the DAIREL acronym can be interpreted differently at the same time:

- **DA** stands for _Data_, the building block of our work and the fuel of our information society; data can be structured, semi-structured and unstructured, textual or multimedia, as well as heterogeneous - turning data into information is part of our mission;
- **AI** stands for _Artificial Intelligence_, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, transformers, embeddings, generative AI, probabilistic logics and other 'intelligent' data processing and generative technologies we are applying in our work;
- **I** stands for _Interaction_, to emphasise our human-centric approach to investigate how users are interacting with data and information for their tasks, and to provide fair and unbiased solutions for effective access to, and interaction with, data and information;
- **IR** stands for _Information Retrieval_, the task of satisfying users' information needs;
- **REL** stands for _Relevance_, a core concept in Information Retrieval with its aim to divide relevant from irrelevant information;
- **L** stands for _Language_, including (generative) natural language processing, word embeddings and large language models.

We think all these different parts that make DAIREL should not be seen in isolation, but need to be integrated.
