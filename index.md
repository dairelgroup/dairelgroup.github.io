# About DAIREL

DAIREL is a Data Science research group at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK. The group focuses on all aspects of data, information and the interaction with it, with the aim to reduce Information Overload. DAIREL's research tries to bridge the gap between data-driven (e.g., application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Language Technologies in Big Data collections) and user-driven (e.g., by looking at how users interact with information) approaches. DAIREL follows a holistic view that combines a system-oriented with a user-oriented view. In the nature of the thought experiment of Schr√∂dinger's Cat, the different n-grams of DAIREL can be interpreted differently at the same time:

- **DA** stands for _data_, the building block of our work and the fuel of our information society;
- **AI** stands for _Artificial Intelligence_, including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Transformers, Logics and all the exciting tools that are available for data processing and generation;
- **I** stands for _Interaction_, to investigate how users are using and interacting with data and information for their tasks and provide solutions to enable them to do so in a fair and unbiased manner;
- **IRE** stands for _Information Retrieval_, the task of satisfying user's information needs;
- **REL** stands for _Relevance_; to tackle information overload, we need to separate relevant from irrelevant information;
- **L** stands for _language_, including (generative) language technologies and Large Language Models, essential tools to help analyse textual and multimodal data, and driving conversational agents.

We think to develop effective and efficient applications and services, all these different parts that make DAIREL should not be seen in isolation, but need to be integrated.
